# About
This project is a YouTube clone developed by a team of two, Shon and Amit. It consists of a [website](https://github.com/amitbrown21/Hemi-Tube-DB) and an [Android app](https://github.com/amitbrown21/Hemi-Tube-Android-DB) that aim to replicate the core functionalities of YouTube.

## Building process

Our team started the development process by focusing on the website. We divided the tasks and agreed upon the specific parts of the website each team member would work on. Once each part was completed, we integrated all the components to create a cohesive and functional website. After completing the website, we shifted our attention to the Android app, following a similar approach to create a functional Android app that complements the website.
